This is a neat page for people to represent their Spotify playlist. I love playlist-culture for many reasons and sharing playlist carries a special feeling as well. This is also a small project for me to try out things (like Svelte), so while I woulnd't keep it too complex, it's still a thing that could move quickly.

## Build + Run
You need Node.js and npm installed.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Adding your own playlist
In [lists.json](assets/lists.json), you can add your own playlist at the bottom of the list. Create a pull request and I'll merge and deploy it relatively soon.
For `url` you should use the embed link Spotify provides you when right clicking on it -> ["Copy embed link"](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/generate/embed/). For user, use any combination of name and URL you'd like to link back to you.
